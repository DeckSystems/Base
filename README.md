HoneyBadger
An abstract, Rust-language, futures-based implementation of HoneyBadgerBFT.

Currently in-progress.

The paper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/199.pdf

The python implementation: https://github.com/amiller/HoneyBadgerBFT

Architecture
While the HoneyBadgerBFT paper goes into detail about exact instantiations of the primitives it needs to function, the architecture of this crate is trait-based, allowing the interfaces to be fulfilled by various instantiations of communication protocols, ACS, and threshold signature schemes.

Deployment in an actual blockchain
HoneyBadgerBFT effectively reaches agreement for the produced block in an epoch r with up to t malicious participants (3t + 1 <= N).

However, the block produced at an epoch doesn't have any justification for its production. The protocol would have to be extended with an additional signature-collection phase at the end, with the generated threshold signature being included in the block.

This will provide justification for each block in the chain, allowing a peer with only the genesis (or latest checkpoint) to synchronize the head of the chain securely.
